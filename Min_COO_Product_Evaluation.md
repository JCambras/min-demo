### Technology Stack (Actual Products)

| Category | Product | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| CRM | Salesforce Financial Services Cloud | Migrated from Redtail 3 years ago. Still paying Accelerize360 $2,800/month for ongoing customization. |
| Custodian | Schwab | Primary. 98% of assets. |
| Custodian (considering) | Fidelity | One institutional relationship — a $22M endowment — requires Fidelity. David's been "thinking about it" for 6 months. |
| Portfolio Management | Orion | Reporting and billing. Sarah hates the interface but it works. |
| Financial Planning | MoneyGuidePro | Advisors use it. Sarah never touches it. |
| Document Management | SharePoint | Loosely organized. Tyler is supposed to maintain the folder structure. He doesn't. |
| E-Signature | DocuSign | Standard. Works fine. |
| Compliance | SmartRIA | Annual review tracking. Sarah runs the calendar manually anyway because she doesn't trust the reminders. |
| Communication | Outlook + Teams | The firm lives in Outlook. David refuses to use Teams. |
| Reporting | Excel | Sarah's actual operating system. 14 spreadsheets, updated weekly, linked to nothing. |

### How She Got Here

Sarah joined Ridgeline in 2016 as a Client Service Associate. She had three years at Raymond James doing backoffice operations, then two years at a smaller Nashville RIA that was acquired by Mariner Wealth. She watched that integration fail — saw a $600M practice lose 12% of clients in the first year because nobody tracked whose tasks belonged to whom. When she joined Ridgeline, she said: "I'll never let that happen here."

She was promoted to Operations Manager in 2019, then COO in 2022 when David acknowledged that she was running the firm while he was golfing with clients. She doesn't have an equity stake. David has "talked about" a succession plan. She has a standing offer from a PE-backed aggregator in Charlotte that she hasn't said no to yet.

### Her Daily Routine

**6:45 AM** — Opens Outlook on her phone in bed. Scans for anything on fire. Checks DocuSign status on three pending account openings.

**7:30 AM** — At the office. Opens her "Morning Check" spreadsheet (Excel). Manually reviews:
- Schwab alerts (logs into Schwab Advisor Center)
- Overdue tasks in Salesforce (runs a saved report, "SK Overdue Tasks")
- DocuSign pending envelopes (logs into DocuSign admin)
- Any compliance deadlines from SmartRIA
- This takes 35-45 minutes

**8:30 AM** — Standup with Amanda, Tyler, and Priya. Assigns work from the spreadsheet. Amanda handles complex account openings. Tyler does data entry and moves paperwork. Priya handles compliance filing and annual review scheduling.

**9:00 AM - 12:00 PM** — "Firefighting." Could be anything: a Schwab NIGO rejection, a client calling about a wire that didn't arrive, a DocuSign envelope stuck in "needs to sign" for 11 days, David asking "whatever happened to the Peterson account opening?", or Alan Marsh's clients calling because he hasn't returned their calls in three weeks.

**12:00 PM** — Lunch at desk. Updates her spreadsheets.

**1:00 PM - 3:00 PM** — Proactive work (when she can get to it): compliance calendar, process documentation, onboarding new clients from the acquisitions, following up on the 23 households from the Garrison Practice that still haven't been fully migrated into Salesforce.

**3:00 PM - 5:00 PM** — Advisor support. Review meetings, prep for tomorrow, answer David's questions about client status. Brett usually needs help with something he should know how to do.

**5:30 PM** — Final scan of DocuSign, Schwab, and email. Makes tomorrow's to-do list on a yellow legal pad. Drives home.

### What Keeps Her Up at Night

1. **The Garrison Integration.** They acquired Jim Garrison's $180M practice 7 months ago. Jim retired immediately. His "CRM" was an Access database and physical files. 47 households, no standardized naming conventions, spotty contact information, and 6 accounts with missing beneficiary designations that nobody noticed until Sarah found them. She's manually migrating every household into Salesforce FSC, one at a time, cross-referencing Schwab records. She's maybe 60% done. The remaining 40% are the messy ones.

2. **Compliance Examination.** Ridgeline's last SEC examination was 2021. They're statistically due. David says "we're fine." Sarah knows they have 14 households that haven't had a suitability review in over 18 months, and 8 accounts opened after the Garrison acquisition where the documentation is... incomplete. She's trying to backfill reviews but she only has Priya, and Priya is still learning.

3. **Scale.** At $400M, Sarah could track everything in her head. At $1B with two acquisitions, she can't. She misses things. Last month, a $4M client's RMD almost wasn't distributed in time because nobody noticed it was due. She caught it with 5 days to spare by accident, while looking at something else. The next one might not be an accident.

4. **Advisor Accountability.** Tom Yoon hasn't logged a meeting note in Salesforce in 4 months. He claims he "keeps it all in his head." Karen is meticulous. Brett is enthusiastic but sloppy. Alan Marsh has 40 households and zero logged activity. Sarah can't run compliance reviews on data that doesn't exist.

### The Failed Implementation

In 2020, Ridgeline bought Wealthbox as their CRM. The sales demo was beautiful. Then:
- Import from Redtail lost custom fields
- The "automation" features required manual configuration that took 60 hours nobody had
- Two advisors refused to use it ("I was fine with Redtail")
- After 5 months and $18,000, they abandoned Wealthbox and went to Salesforce FSC instead (another $45,000 implementation, this time with a consultant)

Sarah's lesson: "A demo is a lie. I need to use it for a week with my actual data before I believe anything."

### Her Evaluation Criteria

1. **Does it work with my data, today?** Not sample data. Not "after you clean up your Salesforce." Today.
2. **Does it replace a spreadsheet?** If it's another tab in my browser that I check in addition to everything else, it's a net negative.
3. **Can Amanda run it without me?** If only I can use it, it doesn't scale.
4. **What happens when it's wrong?** Every system shows wrong data sometimes. The question is whether I can tell when it's wrong, and whether being wrong causes damage.
5. **What's the exit?** If we stop paying, do we lose anything? Is our data hostage?

### Her Team

- **Amanda Chen** — The best person on the team. Knows Schwab inside and out. Handles complex account openings (trusts, entities, TOAs). Doesn't use Salesforce the way Sarah wants her to — she keeps her own tracking in a separate Excel file because "Salesforce is slow." Sarah can't argue because Amanda's spreadsheet is actually more accurate than Salesforce.
- **Tyler Brooks** — Willing, but needs supervision. Handles data entry, DocuSign follow-up, and basic account maintenance. Makes mistakes when he rushes. Sarah reviews everything Tyler touches before it goes out.
- **Priya Mehta** — Smart, hired specifically for compliance, but only has 1 year of experience. She's learning fast but can't run a compliance review independently yet. She's Sarah's hope for the SEC examination.

### The Bottleneck

The operational bottleneck limiting growth: **Sarah is the single point of failure for every non-trivial decision.** Account opening takes 7-12 days because Sarah has to review every application before it goes to Schwab. Compliance reviews happen when Sarah finds time. Advisor follow-up only happens because Sarah tracks it in her spreadsheet. If Sarah gets sick for a week, the firm doesn't stop — but it starts accumulating errors that take three weeks to unwind.

David has said he'd "love to hire another ops person." He hasn't approved the headcount. Min would be worth it to Sarah if it could make Amanda autonomous on the things only Sarah does today.

# PART 2: ONE WEEK WITH MIN

## Monday — The Onboarding Fire

### Morning Context
The Cheng household ($3.8M) account opening that started 9 days ago is stuck — Schwab rejected the trust account paperwork (NIGO) because the trust certification was missing a signature date. Sarah discovers this in a Schwab Advisor Center email at 7:15 AM. The Chengs are David's top prospect-turned-client; he'll ask about it by 9 AM.

Additionally, Priya is out sick. Tyler is handling her compliance tasks today, which means he's going to need supervision.

### Her Interactions with Min
Sarah logs in for the first time. She chose the Operations role during setup and connected Salesforce.

**8:00 AM** — Opens Min's Operations Dashboard. Sees the Practice Health Score ring — 64/100. Immediately notices the household health cards: 8 cards color-coded by health. Three are red. She clicks the Thompson household (a renamed demo household that maps to her Garrison acquisition data) and sees the "Why this score?" decomposition: overdue tasks, no compliance review on file, unsigned DocuSign envelope aging at 11 days.

She thinks: *"Okay, this is my morning spreadsheet, but it already knows."*

**8:20 AM** — She goes to the Compliance Reviews action card and runs a review on the Cheng household. Watches 12 checks execute in about 30 seconds. KYC passes. Suitability passes. But "Account Documentation" fails — it flags that the trust account has no completion record. The detail says: "Trust account opened 9 days ago, no Schwab confirmation on file, 1 pending DocuSign envelope unsigned."

**8:45 AM** — She opens the Flow screen (Open Account) and selects "Existing Client." Types "Cheng" in the search. Wei Cheng appears in the dropdown with household name. She clicks through and sees the account details. She clicks Quick-fill, and the form auto-populates from Salesforce. She sees the NIGO summary panel, which shows Schwab's trust account requirements.

### The Delight Moment
The NIGO summary. Min shows her exactly what Schwab requires for trust accounts — and flags that the trust certification date field is empty. She didn't have to log into Schwab Advisor Center, compare the rejection email to the form, or call Schwab to ask what was wrong. Min just told her: "Trust certification is missing a date field."

She says to Amanda: *"It's like it read the NIGO rejection before I did."*

### The Frustration
She wants to forward the corrected trust certification to Schwab directly from Min. She can't. Min shows her what's wrong but doesn't help her fix it — she still has to download the corrected form, email it to Amanda, and have Amanda upload it through Schwab Advisor Center.

Also: she looks for the Cheng household's DocuSign status in Min. It's not there. Min created the envelope tracking when she used the Flow screen, but the DocuSign envelope that was sent 9 days ago through DocuSign directly (before Min existed) isn't tracked.

### The Workaround
She opens DocuSign in another tab to check the pending envelope status, then manually copies the status into her spreadsheet. She also emails Amanda the NIGO details rather than using Min's "Send to CRM" feature because Amanda doesn't have Min access yet.

### End-of-Day Assessment
*"The health score dashboard is genuinely better than my spreadsheet. But it's reading from Salesforce, and half my Salesforce data is garbage — so it's a pretty dashboard on top of an ugly foundation."*

---

## Tuesday — The Acquisition Reckoning

### Morning Context
Sarah planned to spend the morning migrating 5 more Garrison Practice households into Salesforce. She has Jim Garrison's paper files and a Schwab report showing the accounts. The goal: create the household in Salesforce, link the contacts, verify the account data against Schwab, and flag any missing compliance items.

Also: Tom Yoon stopped by at 8:15 to say he "forgot" to log his three client meetings from last week. He wants Sarah to "just enter them" because he's busy.

### Her Interactions with Min
**8:30 AM** — Opens the dashboard. Notices the Advisor Scoreboard. Tom Yoon's row shows 0 meetings logged in the past 7 days, 4 overdue tasks, and a compliance score of 61%. She screenshots this. She's been trying to tell David that Tom's documentation is a problem. Now she has data.

**9:00 AM** — Opens a Garrison household (the Nakamura account) in Min's family view. She had migrated this household into Salesforce last week. Min shows: 1 contact (Kenji Nakamura), $780K AUM, health score of 38 (red). The "Why" decomposition shows: no compliance review ever run, no meeting logged in 90+ days, 2 overdue tasks, and the household was "onboarded 35 days ago" with no KYC review.

She runs a compliance review on Nakamura. 12 checks run. 4 fail: KYC, suitability, ADV delivery, and beneficiary designation. The detail for each is specific: "No identity verification documentation on file." "No investment objective or risk tolerance recorded."

She thinks: *"This is exactly what an SEC examiner would find. Min just ran the examination for me."*

**10:30 AM** — She opens the Risk Radar on the dashboard. Filters to "Critical." She sees 6 items. Three are Garrison households she migrated with incomplete data. Two are Alan Marsh households with no activity in 90+ days. One is a DocuSign envelope unsigned for 14 days.

### The Delight Moment
The compliance review on Nakamura. It's specific enough that Sarah can hand the results to Priya (when she's back) and say: "Here are the 4 things you need to fix for this household. Get the KYC docs from Schwab, record the risk tolerance in Salesforce, confirm ADV delivery, and call about the beneficiary." That's a 15-minute assignment instead of a 2-hour research project.

She downloads the compliance PDF report. It generates instantly. She thinks: *"I can put this in the SEC examination file."*

### The Frustration
She wants to see the Garrison households that she *hasn't* migrated yet — the ones still sitting in Jim's Access database and paper files. Min only knows what's in Salesforce. The 19 households she hasn't migrated are invisible. She needs a "gap list" — households at Schwab that aren't in Salesforce — and Min can't produce it because it doesn't compare Schwab account data against Salesforce household records directly.

Also: she tries to run compliance reviews in batch on all Garrison households. The batch scan feature works, but it runs them one at a time and she has to wait. For 28 migrated Garrison households, this takes about 14 minutes of watching a progress bar.

### The Workaround
She opens her master "Garrison Migration" spreadsheet in Excel. Cross-references the Schwab Advisor Center account list with her Salesforce household list. Highlights the 19 unmatched accounts. None of this involves Min.

### End-of-Day Assessment
*"Min is excellent at telling me what's wrong with data I already have in Salesforce. It can't help me with data I don't have yet, and right now, that's half my problem."*

---

## Wednesday — The Compliance Drill

### Morning Context
David walks in at 8:00 AM and says: "I got a call from our compliance consultant. She thinks we should do a mock examination before year-end. Can you pull together our documentation?" Sarah has been dreading this. She knows the Garrison households are exposure. She has 3 hours before a 1:00 PM call with the consultant.

### Her Interactions with Min
**8:15 AM** — Opens Min. Goes straight to the dashboard. Looks at the Practice Health Score breakdown: Compliance Coverage is at 67%. She clicks the detail — Min shows that 33% of households have never had a compliance review. She clicks through and sees the list: mostly Garrison households, plus Alan Marsh's neglected book.

**8:45 AM** — She runs batch compliance reviews on every household she can. The batch processes 47 households (the ones in Salesforce that haven't been reviewed). The results are devastating but useful: 14 households have critical failures (missing KYC, no suitability documentation), 18 have warnings (ADV delivery overdue, meeting frequency gaps), 15 pass clean.

**9:30 AM** — For each failing household, she downloads the compliance PDF. Each PDF has the household name, review date, specific check failures with regulatory citations (FINRA Rule 2090, Reg BI, SEC Rule 204-3), and a next-review-date. She saves 14 PDFs into a "Mock Exam Prep" folder.

**10:15 AM** — She opens the Audit Trail screen. Every action she's taken in Min — every compliance review, every task created, every "Send to CRM" — is logged with timestamps. She exports this as a timeline of remediation activity.

### The Delight Moment
The compliance PDFs. Each one is formatted like a professional examination document with regulatory citations, pass/fail breakdowns, attestation blocks, and signature lines. Sarah's compliance consultant charges $400/hour to produce documents like these. Min generated 14 of them in 10 minutes.

She calls Priya: *"When you're back, I need you to work through these PDFs one by one. Each one tells you exactly what to fix."*

### The Frustration
The compliance checks are good but generic. Min checks for "KYC Identity Verification" as a binary — it's either documented in Salesforce or it's not. But Sarah knows that for trust accounts, KYC requirements are different than for individual accounts. For entity accounts (the two small endowments), the requirements are different again. Min treats all households the same.

Also: Min's compliance review can't see SmartRIA. Sarah has completed annual reviews for 30 households in SmartRIA, but Min shows them as "never reviewed" because it only reads Salesforce. She's now maintaining two systems that disagree with each other.

### The Workaround
She exports Min's compliance results to Excel. Then opens SmartRIA and exports its review calendar. Manually merges them, marking households that SmartRIA says are reviewed but Min says aren't. Emails the merged spreadsheet to the compliance consultant.

### End-of-Day Assessment
*"Min just did in one morning what would have taken me two weeks. But I still needed Excel to reconcile it with SmartRIA. If Min could talk to SmartRIA — or better yet, replace it — I'd write the check today."*

---

## Thursday — The Advisor Revolt

### Morning Context
David forwarded Sarah an email from Brett Langston at 7:00 AM. Subject: "Too many systems." Brett is frustrated that he now has Salesforce, MoneyGuidePro, Orion, and "some new thing Sarah is testing" (Min). He wants to know why he can't just "do everything in Salesforce." Tom Yoon, who overheard the conversation, is now backing Brett: "We don't need another dashboard."

Also: Mrs. Obrien ($2.1M household) called at 8:30 AM. She's upset because she sent back her signed documents 12 days ago and nobody has confirmed whether her IRA rollover was processed. Sarah doesn't know the status off the top of her head.

### Her Interactions with Min
**8:45 AM** — Opens Min. Searches for "O'Brien" in the family view. Finds the household immediately. Health score: 52 (yellow). The "Why" shows: 2 overdue tasks (including the IRA rollover follow-up), 1 unsigned DocuSign (a different account), and a meeting frequency gap. The suggested actions panel recommends: "Follow up on IRA rollover — overdue by 6 days" and "Send DocuSign reminder — unsigned 12 days."

Sarah clicks "Send to CRM" on the rollover follow-up task. It creates a task in Salesforce assigned to Amanda. She resolves the issue in 90 seconds without opening Salesforce, Schwab, or DocuSign.

**9:30 AM** — She pulls up the Advisor Scoreboard to prepare for a conversation with David about Brett and Tom's complaints. The data is clear:
- Karen Whitfield: 22 households, 0 overdue, 94% compliance, score 91
- Brett Langston: 18 households, 3 overdue, 78% compliance, score 72
- Tom Yoon: 24 households, 8 overdue, 61% compliance, score 54
- Alan Marsh: 40 households, 12 overdue, 23% compliance, score 28

She screenshots this and sends it to David with the note: "The advisors who document their work have healthy books. The ones who don't are creating our compliance exposure. Min didn't create this problem — it's showing us a problem we already had."

### The Delight Moment
The O'Brien resolution. Ninety seconds from "I don't know" to "task assigned and trackable." That sequence — search household, see the problem, create an action, send to CRM — is exactly the workflow Sarah does 15 times a day, but normally it takes her 8-10 minutes per household because she's switching between Salesforce, Schwab, and her spreadsheet.

She calculates: 15 lookups × 7 minutes saved = 105 minutes per day. That's Amanda's entire morning.

### The Frustration
Min shows her what she needs to know about the O'Brien household, but it can't show her the *email trail*. Mrs. O'Brien says she sent the signed documents "12 days ago." Sarah needs to search Outlook to find the email, verify the attachment was received, and check whether Amanda forwarded it to Schwab. Min doesn't integrate with email, so the communication history is invisible.

Brett's complaint also lands: Min is genuinely another system. It reads from Salesforce but it's not *in* Salesforce. Brett has a point — if Min's insights lived inside Salesforce as a panel or widget, adoption would be easier. Instead, it's a separate URL that advisors would need to voluntarily open.

### The Workaround
She searches Outlook for "O'Brien" + "documents" and finds the email from 12 days ago. Amanda had received it but never uploaded it to Schwab — it fell through the cracks. Sarah forwards it to Amanda with a red exclamation mark. None of this happens in Min.

For the advisor adoption question, she doesn't have a workaround. She makes a note: "Ask Min team if there's a Salesforce embed option."

### End-of-Day Assessment
*"Min is making me better at my job. I'm not sure it can make Brett better at his — and if the advisors won't use it, I'm the only one who benefits, and I'm the one who's already doing the work."*

---

## Friday — The Context Blind Spot

### Morning Context
End of week. Sarah is trying to close out three account openings, finalize her SEC mock-exam prep, and plan next week's Garrison migration sprint. She's also processing the week's experience with Min and forming her opinion.

Also: the Jackson household ($1.4M) shows up as "critical" on Min's Risk Radar because their Roth conversion documents have been unsigned for 14 days. What Min doesn't know: Mrs. Jackson is in the hospital. Brett told Sarah about it on Tuesday but didn't log it anywhere. The Roth conversion is deliberately paused.

### Her Interactions with Min
**8:00 AM** — Opens Min's dashboard. Risk Radar shows the Jackson household as critical. She knows the context — hospital stay, everything paused — but Min doesn't. She can't tell Min "this is expected, snooze this alert." Min will keep flagging it as critical every day until someone signs the documents or the alert ages off.

She looks for a way to add a note or tag to the household. There's no annotation layer. Min shows her Salesforce data but she can't write context back *into* Min. She can create a task via "Send to CRM" but she can't say "this household is on hold because of a medical situation, suppress alerts for 30 days."

**9:30 AM** — She reviews the Pipeline section on the dashboard. It shows 5 accounts in various stages of opening, including the Cheng trust (still waiting for corrected docs), a new O'Brien IRA rollover, and three Garrison TOAs. The pipeline view shows age in days for each. She can see that the Garrison TOAs have been in "pending" for 22 days — longer than they should be.

She clicks into a Garrison TOA household. Min shows the household data from Salesforce, but the TOA tracking is in Schwab, not Salesforce. Min knows the account exists but doesn't know the TOA status. She still has to log into Schwab Advisor Center to check transfer status.

**11:00 AM** — She runs one final compliance review on the entire book — all households. Downloads the aggregate results. 67% pass rate on compliance coverage. She opens the Health Score section and downloads the Weekly Report PDF. It's a clean one-page summary: practice health score, advisor breakdown, risk summary, pipeline status.

She puts the compliance PDFs and the weekly report into a folder labeled "Min Evaluation — Week 1" and emails it to David.

### The Delight Moment
The weekly report PDF. It's the kind of document Sarah has been manually creating every Friday afternoon for David — practice status, what's overdue, what's coming up, who's falling behind. She's been spending 90 minutes every Friday building this in Excel. Min generates it in 2 seconds.

### The Frustration
The Jackson household is the crystallization of a deeper problem: **Min doesn't know what it doesn't know.** It can read Salesforce and apply rules, but it has no concept of human context — medical emergencies, intentional delays, client preferences, advisor judgment calls. It flags everything by the same rubric, and there's no way to say "I know, and it's okay."

This means every Monday morning, Sarah will have false positives in her critical alerts. Over time, alert fatigue will set in. She'll start ignoring the Risk Radar because 3 of the 6 critical items are things she already knows about and has decided to defer.

### The Workaround
She opens Salesforce and adds a note to the Jackson household Activity: "Per Brett — Tamika Jackson hospitalized. All pending items on hold until further notice. -SK 2/21/26." Min will still flag it as critical, but at least the context exists somewhere.

### End-of-Day Assessment
*"I could not go back to not having this. But I also can't use it as my single source of truth — it's too rigid. It's the best read-only dashboard I've ever seen for my Salesforce data. I need it to be read-write, context-aware, and integrated with the three other systems I live in."*

# PART 3: THE POST-EVALUATION INTERVIEW

**Interviewer:** Let's start from the beginning. Walk me through opening Min for the first time on Monday morning. What did you think?

**Sarah:** Honestly? I was skeptical. I've been burned. When the dashboard loaded and I saw the health score ring at 64, my first thought was, "Where is it getting that number?" So I clicked into the breakdown, and it showed me the four components — compliance coverage, DocuSign velocity, task completion, meeting frequency — with the weights. That transparency matters. SmartRIA gives me a compliance score too, but I have no idea how it calculates it.

The household cards were what hooked me. Eight households, color-coded, and I could immediately see which ones were red. I clicked the Thompson household and hit "Why this score?" and it gave me plain English: "3 overdue tasks, no compliance review, 1 unsigned DocuSign aging 11 days." That's my morning spreadsheet. It took Min 2 seconds to show me what takes me 40 minutes to assemble.

**Interviewer:** You used the compliance reviews heavily. Walk me through what worked and what didn't.

**Sarah:** The individual reviews are excellent. Twelve checks, 30 seconds, specific regulatory citations. When I ran the Nakamura review and saw "No identity verification — FINRA Rule 2090" with the detail showing exactly what's missing, I thought: this is what an SEC examiner would find. And the PDF export — I mean, I could hand that to my compliance consultant and she'd think I paid someone to prepare it.

What didn't work: the checks are one-size-fits-all. A trust account has different KYC requirements than an individual account. An entity account — we have two small endowments — is completely different. Min treats my 70-year-old widow's individual IRA the same as a $5M revocable trust. The checks should adapt based on account type.

And the batch scan — I ran 47 households. It worked, but it took 14 minutes. I was just watching a progress bar. If I'm going to run the whole book, I want to kick it off and come back to it.

**Interviewer:** Was there a moment during the week where Min surprised you? Where it surfaced something you didn't expect?

**Sarah:** Wednesday morning. I was pulling together mock exam prep and I ran batch reviews on the whole book. Fourteen households failed critical checks. I knew about maybe eight of them. The other six — I didn't know. Two were Alan Marsh households where the beneficiary designations were never updated after a spouse died. That's not just a compliance gap, that's a client service failure. If the surviving spouse had passed away, the assets would have gone to a deceased beneficiary designation. Min found that because it checked whether beneficiary contacts matched active contacts in Salesforce. I would never have caught that in my spreadsheet.

**Interviewer:** Was there a moment where you almost gave up on it?

**Sarah:** Friday. The Jackson household. Min is screaming at me — critical alert, unsigned Roth conversion, 14 days overdue. And I know the client is in the hospital. Brett told me on Tuesday. But there's no way to tell Min "I know, stand down." I can't snooze an alert. I can't add context. I can't tag a household as "on hold."

If I can't manage the noise, the Risk Radar becomes useless within a month. I'll have 10 critical alerts, 6 of which I've already triaged, and I'll start ignoring the other 4 — and one of those will be a real problem I missed because of alert fatigue.

**Interviewer:** If you could add three things to Min tomorrow, what would they be?

**Sarah:** One: **alert management.** Snooze, dismiss with a reason, override with context. Let me say "I know about this, check back in 30 days." Log the override in the audit trail so it's defensible.

Two: **email integration.** Not full email management — I don't need another Outlook. But when I'm looking at a household in Min, I want to see the last 5 emails about that client. Half of my "what's the status?" questions are answered by searching Outlook. If Min could surface recent email threads by household, I'd save an hour a day.

Three: **multi-custodian data.** We're about to add Fidelity for one institutional relationship. Min only reads Schwab through Salesforce. If I have clients at two custodians, I need one dashboard. This is table stakes for any firm above $500M — most have at least two custodial relationships.

**Interviewer:** If you were going to roll this out to your ops team, what concerns would you have?

**Sarah:** Amanda would love it. She's already doing the same analysis manually and she'd appreciate the speed. Tyler needs guardrails — Min would actually help because the compliance reviews would flag his mistakes before they leave the building.

My concern is training time. Min is intuitive for someone like me who understands the underlying data. Tyler doesn't always understand why a beneficiary designation matters. Min tells him it's missing, but it doesn't tell him *what to do about it*. I'd want guided remediation steps — not just "fail: no beneficiary" but "fail: no beneficiary → here's the Schwab beneficiary change form → here's who to call."

**Interviewer:** Your advisors interact with Salesforce directly. How does Min change their experience?

**Sarah:** It doesn't, and that's a problem. Min is an ops tool. Brett and Tom will never open it voluntarily. If Min's insights — the health scores, the overdue alerts, the compliance gaps — were embedded in Salesforce as a component or sidebar, advisors would see them in the tool they already use. Right now, I'm the translation layer. Min shows me the problem, I tell the advisor in a Teams message, the advisor ignores the Teams message for three days.

**Interviewer:** You're integrating two acquired practices. How well did Min handle that?

**Sarah:** For the households I've already migrated into Salesforce — great. Min instantly shows me what's missing. The compliance review on Garrison households was the highest-value thing I did all week.

For the households I haven't migrated — Min is blind. It only sees Salesforce. I have 19 Garrison households that exist at Schwab but aren't in Salesforce yet. Min can't show me that gap. What I really need is: "Here are 19 accounts at your custodian that don't match any household in your CRM." That's the acquisition integration killer feature, and it doesn't exist.

**Interviewer:** Do you trust Min's data?

**Sarah:** I trust it to accurately reflect what's in Salesforce. The source attribution — showing "Salesforce" with a freshness timestamp on every data point — is smart. I can see when data was last updated.

But Salesforce is only as good as what people put in. Tom hasn't logged a meeting in 4 months. Min shows his meeting coverage as zero, which is technically accurate but operationally misleading — he's having meetings, he's just not documenting them. Min can't tell the difference between "no meetings happened" and "meetings happened but nobody recorded them." That's not Min's fault, but it means I can't take the health scores at face value without knowing the data quality underneath.

**Interviewer:** Min doesn't show you revenue data. How much does that matter?

**Sarah:** A lot. When David asks me "how's the practice doing?" he doesn't mean compliance coverage. He means revenue. I have Orion for that, but it's a separate login, separate dashboard, separate mental model. If Min showed me AUM by household alongside the health score, I could prioritize differently. A $200K household with a compliance gap and a $5M household with a compliance gap are not the same priority. Right now, Min treats them equally.

Actually — I noticed the dashboard has a Revenue Intelligence section with estimated AUM. It's pulling from Salesforce account data. That's a start, but it's not reconciled against Orion's actual billing data. Close, but not there.

**Interviewer:** What would prevent you from buying Min today?

**Sarah:** Two things. First: I need to know it works when Salesforce data is messy — and my data is messy. The demo was on clean data. My real data has duplicate contacts, households with no linked accounts, and tasks assigned to people who don't work here anymore. I need to test it on my actual org before I commit.

Second: I need to understand the SOC 2 situation, the data handling, and what happens if Min goes away. You're a small company. My compliance consultant will ask. My E&O carrier might ask. David will definitely ask. "What happens if this startup disappears in 18 months and all our compliance documentation was generated by their system?"

**Interviewer:** If you had to pitch Min to David in 60 seconds, what would you say?

**Sarah:** "David, I spend two hours every morning figuring out what's broken across 140 households, and I still miss things. Last month I almost missed an RMD. Min shows me everything that needs attention in 30 seconds, with the specific regulatory reason why it matters, and generates audit-ready documentation automatically. The SEC mock exam prep that would have taken me two weeks took me one morning. It doesn't replace Salesforce or Schwab — it sits on top of them and tells me what they can't: which clients are at risk and why. It costs less than one month of the compliance consultant we're about to hire."

# PART 4: BOARD OF ADVISORS REVIEW

**David Kim (Strategic Advisor, former CEO of $5B RIA):** I'll start. The COO's feedback confirms what I suspected: Min's positioning is correct but its boundary is wrong. She said it — "the best read-only dashboard I've ever seen." Read-only is a feature for Week 1 demos. It's a limitation for Week 5 adoption. The strategic question is: does Min stay as an intelligence layer or does it become a workflow execution layer?

The acquisition integration gap she described — "show me accounts at my custodian that aren't in my CRM" — that's a $50K problem for every acquiring firm. There are 200+ RIA acquisitions per year. If Min becomes the tool you use during M&A integration, that's a wedge that no competitor occupies.

**Lisa Huang (Enterprise Sales Advisor):** The deal-breaker answer is the one I'd focus on. She said two things: "test it on my actual org" and "what happens if your startup disappears." Those are the two objections I hear in every enterprise sales cycle above $50K ACV. The first one is solvable with a pilot program — 30-day free trial on their production Salesforce org. The second one is solvable with documentation: SOC 2 Type II (or a credible timeline), data export functionality, and a contractual clause about data portability.

But here's what concerns me more: she said her advisors will never open Min. If the buyer (the COO) loves it but the users (the advisors) won't touch it, you have a champion without an army. At $250K ACV that's fine — the COO signs the check. At $50K ACV, procurement committees want user adoption metrics. I'd invest in a Salesforce Lightning component that surfaces Min's health scores and alerts inside Salesforce natively. That turns it from "another tab" to "the smartest part of your CRM."

**Raj Patel (Technology Advisor):** The architecture question is about data flow direction. Right now, Min reads from Salesforce and writes back via "Send to CRM." That's the correct initial architecture — low risk, no data residency issues, the CRM is the system of record.

But what breaks: multi-custodian. She mentioned Fidelity. Min currently gets custodial data through Salesforce (which gets it from whoever syncs Schwab data into FSC). Adding Fidelity means either (a) the firm syncs Fidelity data into Salesforce themselves, or (b) Min connects to a custodial data aggregator — BridgeFT, Addepar, Orion. Option B is the right architecture long-term because it decouples Min from the CRM's data quality for custodial data. But it's a 2-3 month build.

The batch compliance scan taking 14 minutes for 47 households — that's a scalability signal. A $5B firm has 500+ households. That's over two hours. The scan needs to be asynchronous: kick it off, go do other things, get a notification when it's done.

**Maria Santos (Regulatory Advisor):** The compliance PDF is the most strategically important feature Min has, and I don't think the team knows it. Here's why: in an SEC examination, the examiner asks for documentation. If Min generates a timestamped PDF with regulatory citations, check results, and an attestation block — and that PDF is logged in an audit trail — that's an *examination-ready artifact.* Most RIAs show up with spreadsheets and hope.

The gap she identified about account-type-specific checks is real but solvable. The current checks are good for 80% of accounts. Add trust-specific checks (trust certification, trustee verification, decanting provisions) and entity-specific checks (authorized signers, board resolution, ERISA status), and you cover 95%.

But here's the risk nobody's mentioned: Min is generating compliance documentation using AI logic. If Min says "KYC: PASS" and the examiner disagrees, who's liable? The firm, obviously — Min is a tool, not an advisor. But the firm's E&O carrier will ask: "Did you rely on automated compliance software? Was it validated?" Min needs a disclaimer on every PDF: "This report is a decision-support tool. Final compliance determinations remain the responsibility of the firm's Chief Compliance Officer."

**James Washington (Operations Advisor, COO of $3B MFO):** I would use this. Today. The morning dashboard alone saves my team 2 hours. At my scale — 400 households, 6 ops people — that's 12 person-hours per day across the team.

But I'd hit the same wall she did on Day 5. The alert fatigue problem is real and it's urgent. At 140 households, she has 6 false positives. At 400, I'd have 20. You need three things: (1) snooze with a reason, (2) dismiss with an override, and (3) a "known issues" filter that suppresses acknowledged items from the critical view. Without this, power users will stop trusting the Risk Radar within 60 days.

The thing she said about "guided remediation" — not just flagging the problem but telling Tyler what to do about it — that's the difference between a dashboard and a workflow tool. A dashboard says "beneficiary missing." A workflow tool says "beneficiary missing → click here to download Schwab's beneficiary change form → assign to Amanda → follow up in 7 days." That's what separates a $20K ACV tool from a $100K ACV tool.

**David Kim:** So let me try to synthesize. The three strategically important gaps, as I see them:

1. **Alert management / context layer** — Without it, power users churn within 90 days due to alert fatigue. This is a retention risk. Must fix before scaling beyond early adopters.

2. **Guided remediation workflows** — The difference between "intelligence layer" and "workflow orchestration." This is the pricing lever. Must fix before charging enterprise pricing.

3. **Acquisition integration tooling** — Custodian-to-CRM reconciliation. This is the wedge into a market that buys in panic (during M&A due diligence). Build after 10 customers, but have the roadmap ready for sales conversations.

**Lisa Huang:** I'd swap #3 and argue that the **Salesforce Lightning embed** is more important for sales. It solves the advisor adoption problem, which is a procurement objection.

**James Washington:** I disagree with Lisa. Advisors don't need to use Min — the COO and ops team do. Salesforce embed is a nice-to-have. Alert management is a must-have.

**David Kim:** Agreed. The single highest-leverage investment: **alert management with contextual overrides and audit-logged dismissals.** It's the feature that turns Week 1 enthusiasm into Month 6 retention.

**The competitive threat:** Lisa, what's the competitive angle?

**Lisa Huang:** Practifi. They're on Salesforce natively. If Practifi adds health scoring and compliance automation — and they will, because their PE backers want feature parity with anyone entering their market — they'll argue: "Why add another tool when your CRM already does it?" Min needs to be meaningfully better than "Practifi plus a compliance module," and right now the compliance PDF and the health decomposition are the differentiators. Protect those.

# PART 5: OPERATING TEAM REVIEW

**Elena Vasquez (VP Customer Experience):** Okay, I've read Sarah's interview three times. Let me pull out the moments that matter for our demo.

The 90-second O'Brien resolution is our demo centerpiece. Search → See the problem → Create an action → Send to CRM. That sequence is worth building the entire demo around. When she said "15 lookups times 7 minutes saved equals 105 minutes per day" — that's our ROI sound bite.

The compliance PDF download is our second hero moment. She said it would have taken her two weeks to prepare for the mock exam. Min did it in one morning. That's a before-and-after we can stage.

**Dr. Omar Hassan (UX Researcher):** Let me go through the interaction failures systematically.

**The punch list — 10 items, prioritized:**

1. **Alert snooze / dismiss with context** — She cannot suppress known false positives. Every critical alert she's already triaged reappears the next morning. This erodes trust in the Risk Radar.
   - **Effort:** Sprint (1-3 weeks)
   - **Affects:** Production product
   - **Design:** Add three actions to each Risk Radar item: "Resolve" (mark done), "Snooze" (suppress for N days with a required reason), "Dismiss" (permanent suppress with required reason). Log all actions in audit trail.

2. **Compliance checks by account type** — Trust, entity, and individual accounts should have different check matrices. She flagged that trust KYC requirements differ from individual.
   - **Effort:** Sprint (1-3 weeks)
   - **Affects:** Both demo and production
   - **Design:** Add `accountType` parameter to compliance engine. Map existing checks to types. Add trust-specific checks (certification, trustee verification) and entity-specific checks (authorized signers, ERISA).

3. **Guided remediation on check failures** — Don't just say "FAIL: beneficiary missing." Say "FAIL: beneficiary missing → [Download Schwab Form] → [Assign to team member] → [Follow up in 7 days]."
   - **Effort:** Project (1+ month)
   - **Affects:** Production product
   - **Design:** Each compliance check failure gets a remediation action template with custodian-specific form links and assignable follow-up tasks.

4. **Async batch compliance scans** — 14 minutes for 47 households is too slow. Needs to be background with notification.
   - **Effort:** Sprint (1-3 weeks)
   - **Affects:** Production product
   - **Design:** Move batch scan to background process. Show progress indicator. Notify via in-app notification when complete. Allow user to navigate away.

5. **Household annotation / notes layer** — She wanted to add "client hospitalized, all items on hold" to the Jackson household. Min has no way to store user context that isn't in Salesforce.
   - **Effort:** Sprint (1-3 weeks)
   - **Affects:** Production product
   - **Design:** Add a "Notes" field per household in Min (stored locally or in Salesforce as a custom field). Display notes prominently on household detail view. Option to write back to Salesforce.

6. **Compliance disclaimer on PDFs** — Per the regulatory advisor, every compliance PDF should state: "Decision-support tool. Final compliance determinations remain the responsibility of the firm's CCO."
   - **Effort:** Quick Win (< 1 week)
   - **Affects:** Both demo and production
   - **Design:** Add footer disclaimer to PDF template. Add checkbox attestation: "I have reviewed these results and accept responsibility for compliance determinations."

7. **Revenue data integration with health scoring** — She wants AUM alongside health scores to prioritize by client value. The Revenue Intelligence section exists but isn't woven into health scores.
   - **Effort:** Sprint (1-3 weeks)
   - **Affects:** Both demo and production
   - **Design:** Add AUM badge to household health cards. Allow sorting by AUM. Weight health score priority by AUM tier (optional).

8. **Data quality indicator** — Min reflects Salesforce data quality. She noted Tom Yoon's zero meetings are technically accurate but operationally misleading. Min should flag when data is likely stale or incomplete.
   - **Effort:** Sprint (1-3 weeks)
   - **Affects:** Production product
   - **Design:** Add "Data Confidence" indicator per household. Flag: no activity in 90+ days, no contact email, no linked accounts, etc. Different from health score — this says "the data itself may be unreliable."

9. **Salesforce Lightning embed** — Advisors won't open Min. Surface health scores inside Salesforce.
   - **Effort:** Project (1+ month)
   - **Affects:** Production product
   - **Design:** Salesforce Lightning Web Component showing household health score, top 3 alerts, and link to full Min view.

10. **Custodian-CRM reconciliation** — Show accounts at the custodian that don't match any CRM household. Critical for M&A integration.
    - **Effort:** Project (1+ month)
    - **Affects:** Production product
    - **Design:** Compare custodial account list (via BridgeFT or direct API) against Salesforce households. Surface unmatched accounts as "orphan" alerts.

**Rachel Toriyama (Staff Engineer):** From a build perspective, items 1, 5, and 6 are the ones I'd ship this week. Alert snooze is state management — we need a `dismissals` store (could be localStorage for now, Salesforce custom object for persistence). Household notes is similar. The PDF disclaimer is a one-line addition to the template.

Items 2 and 4 are the next sprint. Account-type-specific checks means parameterizing the compliance engine — the architecture supports it, we just need the check definitions. Async batch is a UI pattern change, not an architecture change.

Items 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are real projects. Guided remediation requires a custodian-specific knowledge base. The Salesforce embed is a different deployment target. Custodian reconciliation requires a new data source.

**Elena:** Let me draft the revised Day 1 Demo Script addressing the top 3 gaps:

### Revised Demo Script

**Scene 1: "Your Monday Morning" (90 seconds)**
Open dashboard → Health score ring → Household cards sorted by health → Click worst household → "Why this score?" decomposition. **NEW:** Show AUM badge on each card so the audience sees we know which households matter most.

**Scene 2: "Find and Fix" (60 seconds)**
Search for a household → See the problem (overdue task, missing beneficiary) → Click "Send to CRM" → Task created in Salesforce. **NEW:** After creating the task, show the remediation guidance: "Next step: Download Schwab Beneficiary Change Form [link]. Assign to your ops team. Follow up in 7 days."

**Scene 3: "Compliance in 30 Seconds" (90 seconds)**
Run a compliance review on a single household → Watch 12 checks execute → See pass/warn/fail with regulatory citations → Download the PDF. **NEW:** Show the PDF with the compliance disclaimer and attestation block. Say: "This is what you hand to the SEC examiner. It took 30 seconds."

**Scene 4: "The Whole Book" (60 seconds)**
Run batch compliance on the full book → **NEW:** Show it running in the background with progress notification. Jump to results: "14 households need attention. 15 are clean. Here are the 14 PDFs, ready for your examination file."

**Scene 5: "Control the Noise" (45 seconds)**
Show Risk Radar with 6 critical items → **NEW:** Snooze one item ("Client hospitalized, revisit in 30 days") → Dismiss another ("Resolved via phone, logged in Salesforce") → Show that the audit trail captured both actions with timestamps and reasons. Say: "Your examiners will see that you acknowledged every risk and documented your response."

**Omar:** That script addresses Sarah's core complaint: "Min tells me what's wrong but doesn't help me manage the response." The snooze/dismiss demo and the remediation guidance turn it from a dashboard into a command center.

**Rachel:** I can have items 1, 5, and 6 shippable by end of next week. The demo script changes for scenes 1 and 3 are cosmetic — we can update those today.

**Elena:** Let's do it.

# 10 TAKEAWAYS

**1. Alert fatigue will kill retention.**
Without snooze, dismiss, and contextual overrides on the Risk Radar, power users will stop trusting it within 60 days. Build alert management before scaling beyond early adopters.

**2. The compliance PDF is the most strategically defensible feature.**
It generates examination-ready documentation that compliance consultants charge $400/hour to produce manually. Protect and extend this — add account-type-specific checks, disclaimers, and batch export.

**3. "Read-only intelligence" is a Week 1 demo. "Workflow orchestration" is a Year 1 product.**
The COO wants Min to not just flag problems but guide the resolution: download the right form, assign the right person, follow up on the right date. This is the difference between $20K and $100K ACV.

**4. Advisor adoption requires a Salesforce embed, not a separate URL.**
Advisors will never voluntarily open Min. Surface health scores and alerts inside Salesforce via Lightning Web Component. The COO is the buyer, but procurement committees want user adoption metrics.

**5. Acquisition integration is an unoccupied market wedge.**
200+ RIA acquisitions happen annually. The #1 pain point: "Which accounts at the custodian don't have a corresponding household in our CRM?" No tool answers this today. Build custodian-CRM reconciliation as a premium feature.

**6. Compliance checks must be account-type-aware.**
Trust accounts, entity accounts, and individual accounts have materially different regulatory requirements. One-size-fits-all checks produce false passes on complex accounts and false fails on simple ones.

**7. Data quality is distinct from practice health.**
Min reflects what's in Salesforce. If Salesforce data is stale or incomplete, Min's health scores are misleading. Add a "Data Confidence" indicator so users know when to trust the score and when to investigate the underlying data.

**8. The 90-second O'Brien resolution is the demo centerpiece.**
Search → See problem → Create action → Send to CRM. This sequence saves 7 minutes per household lookup, 15 times per day. Lead every demo with this workflow, not the dashboard.

**9. SOC 2 timeline and data portability are procurement gate requirements.**
Enterprise buyers above $50K ACV will ask two questions: "Do you have SOC 2?" and "What happens to our data if you go out of business?" Have clear answers before pursuing firms above $500M AUM.

**10. The COO's 60-second pitch is better than anything the sales team will write.**
"It shows me everything that needs attention in 30 seconds, with the specific regulatory reason why it matters, and generates audit-ready documentation automatically. The SEC mock exam prep that would have taken me two weeks took me one morning." Use her words.
