## Kill Lines

**At auto-fill:** "One click. Min already knows they live together."

**At PTE flag:** "Most firms forget this until compliance calls."

**At routing lookup:** "No more calling the client back because someone transposed a digit."

**At beneficiaries:** "Your team just skipped 15 minutes of data entry."

**At review:** "Nothing happens until you say go. Min is your assistant, not your replacement."

**After completion:** "[X] minutes. How long did you say this takes your team?"

**At Salesforce:** "This isn't a mockup. Go ahead — click around."
